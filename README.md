# Welcome to Clojure Bridge!

This repository has two apps.

1. A very small sample app to test your install for ClojureBridge
2. A set of Clojure lessons using turtles :turtle:.   

#### Why turtles?

There is a historical context for why the name "turtle" is used.

With a desire to develop children's interest in using computers and learning to program,
[Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) created robots that resembled turtles for them to play with.

The goal was to enable the kids to get the turtle to draw common shapes without a lot of formal training. 
Kids would start with a few simple actions that they understood, like [turning and taking steps](https://youtu.be/bOf4EMN6-XA?t=4m14s).
They would then learn how to relate those actions to programming commands so that the turtle would carry them out.

By laying out a large piece of paper and equipping the turtle with markers,
the kids could [test their ideas](https://youtu.be/bOf4EMN6-XA?t=6m50s) and delight in creating drawings that were unique and interactive.

So in this spirit we've moved the turtle into your computer and you get to decide what to draw, and how.

#### How to move turtles

A turtle can move forward/backward and tilt its head right/left.
Combinations of these will make interesting lines.

See [outline/TURTLE.md](outline/TURTLE.md) for commands that turtles
understand.

For Clojure turtle lessons see [outline/TURTLE-SAMPLES.md](outline/TURTLE-SAMPLES.md).
